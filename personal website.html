    <p>I am Rania Jaziri, an <em><strong>IT industrial and automation engineer</strong></em> graduated from the Superior
        Institute of Applied
        Science
        and Technology <em><strong>INSAT</strong></em>.
        I can proudly say that I am a polyvalent profile who is always seeking for new challenges and for gaining more
        skills. In my previous work experiences, I had the opportunity to embrace my knowledge in quality assurance,
        lean
        management, and lean manufacturing through my internships in
        <em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ask-industries/">ASK INDUSTRIES</strong></em></a> (an
        automative cables industry) and
        <em><strong>Figeac Aero</strong></em> (an aeroneutic pieces construction industry).
        In my end of studies project, I decided to dive into the world of <em>Artificial intelligence</em>
        so I moved to France for six months to work within <em> <strong><a
                    href="https://www.femto-st.fr/en/common-laboratories">FEMTO laboratories</a></strong></em> within
        the
        <em>AS2M department</em> and I developped a <strong>Breast cancer therapy help for decision tool</strong> based
        on previous
        patients cases. In that
        particular internship, I learned<em> Data scrubbing</em> and <em> foundamentals of cognitive machine learning
        </em> using <strong>PYTHON</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>.
        After my graduation, I was enthousiast about running a project of my own.
        I made several tries and I can proudly said that I failed because I know that gained a more than decent
        experience in marketing, communication, negociation and sales.
        I also started Freelancing on <em><strong>Fiverr</strong></em> as a <em> Spokesperson</em> producing
        professional videos for
        organizations, entreprises and business owners all around the world to help them present their companies
        correctly to gain more visibility and eventually to grow their income.
    </p>
    <p>My next experience is you! Living the corporate life and working within a talented team of experts to grow my
        network and technical skills as well.
